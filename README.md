# Realistic Airplane Physics Demo (2026)
Built from scratch following Indie-Pixel's "Intro to Unity Airplane Physics" course.

Features implemented in custom C#:
- Lift, drag, thrust, weight forces
- Stall mechanics + angle-of-attack
- Flaps, ground effect, banking limits
- Clean Rigidbody-based flight model

This is a **clean, asset-free version** of the project intended for portfolio and hiring purposes.  
The original course version uses some paid assets for polish (Cinemachine, Post-Processing, etc.) which are omitted here for licensing reasons.

Playable WebGL build: TBD
